# MHT-CET 2025 Voice Updates

_This is a personal project which gives a voice update whenever there are new messages/updates on the [official website of MHT-CET CAP Rounds 2025](https://fe2025.mahacet.org/)_

_Checking the updates by refreshing the webpage at frequent intervals was very tiring, so I made this simple voice automation program which alerts me whenever a new update is posted on the website :P_

**To run the program, follow the steps:**

- Download all the contents of `src` directory
- Run the main program using the command `python3 main.py`. It runs the main program in a forever (`while`) loop.
- **Note: The Python dependencies required by the main program are automatically installed if the program detects that an important dependency is missing. You can see the list of all the dependencies in the file `requirements.txt` OR you can manually install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`**

And done! You will now start receiving the voice updates!


**Where did I host/run the program?**

_I had an old Android Tablet. I installed **Termux** (can be found on Google Play Store) on it (un-available on newer Android versions)_

**Can I make changes to the program?**

Yes! Sure. Feel free to change anything according to your wishes.

**Thank you!**
